<h1>Comprehension Question</h1>

<p>
At the end of each sentence, you'll be asked to paraphrase what you thought the meaning was. Please refrain from just repeating the sentence as you read it. 
  
  For example if you read a sentence such as, "It was raining cats and dogs when John went out for a walk." 
  
  You could respond, "It was raining hard when John went to go on a walk." 
  
  Do not respond "It was raining cats and dogs when John went out for a walk."
  
  However, please respond to the next comprehension questions with two response options, numbered 1 and 2.

To respond, press the number corresponding to your answer.

<p>
<p>Sometimes the answer to the question will be easy. Sometimes it will require a bit more judgment, or for you to use your broader understanding of what's being expressed.</p>    

<p>We would like you to respond as quickly as you can, so <u>go with your gut instinct</u> about the sentence. You don't need to overthink your response, but some questions may take longer than others to answer.</p>

<p> This experiment is not timed, so take as much time as you need to write out your answer, but do not dwell on it too much. There is no correct answer. </p>
