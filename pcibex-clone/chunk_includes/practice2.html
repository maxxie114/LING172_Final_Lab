<h1>Comprehension Question</h1>

<p>
At the end of each sentence, you'll be asked a multiple-choice comprehension question with 2 responses: numbered 1 &amp; 2.

To respond, press the number corresponding to your answer.

<p>
<p>Sometimes the answer to the question will be easy. Sometimes it will require a bit more judgment, or for you to use your broader understanding of what's being expressed.</p>    

<p>We would like you to respond as quickly as you can, so <u>go with your gut instinct</u> about the sentence. You don't need to overthink your response, but some questions may take longer than others to answer.</p>

<p>If you haven't given a response after 10 seconds, the program will move on.  Using the keyboard (instead of the mouse) will allow you to be faster in judging the sentence, so we recommend that.</p>
