<h1>Being attentive</h1>

<p>This study is designed to take no longer than 40 minutes. You may be a faster reader, and finish it in under that time limit.</p>

<p>You can take a break at any time, as long as you do so after you've answered one question, and before you've moved on to the next sentence. Our estimate of the time it takes to complete the study builds in the expectation that you will take 2-3 breaks.</p>

<p>Please help us ensure that your contribution is as valuable as possible by taking a moment to find a quiet place and time to complete the experiment. We recommend that you maximize your browser window.</p>

<p><strong>Once you advance past the screen, you'll encounter a few practice sentences. When you see the dash (&mdash;), press the spacebar to begin reading.</strong>
