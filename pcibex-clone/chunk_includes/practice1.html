<H1>How to Read</H1>

<P>
Welcome! In this experiment, you'll be reading English sentences and answering a question to probe your understanding of the sentence.
</p>

<p>
You are going to read these sentences <strong>word by word</strong>, at your own pace. Each successive word in the sentence will be revealed as you press the spacebar. </p>

<p>This may seem a little funny at first, but as you gain experience reading this way, you will probably develop a pace that makes the sentences understandable and roughly approximates your natural reading rate. You'll get a chance to practice after these instruction screens.
</p>

<p>
Before each sentence, you will see a dash (&quot;&mdash;&quot;) to indicate that you may begin a sentence. When you see the dash, get ready to read a sentence then press the spacebar to begin.
